## Features
- Money Transfers: Players can perform money transfers between their bank accounts and other players' accounts.
- Withdrawals/Deposits: Players can make withdrawals and deposits to their bank accounts at designated locations such as ATMs or bank branches.
- Unique Bank Identifier: Each player is assigned a unique bank identifier, enabling accurate tracking and management of individual bank accounts.

*PS: Please note that there is currently an issue under development. If a player receives two money transfers within 20 seconds, the first transfer will not be counted and will be discarded from the SQL memory. We are actively working to resolve this issue and appreciate your understanding.*
